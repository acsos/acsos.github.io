I am currently a tenure track professor at the University of Hohenheim who lead the Department of Food Informatics. There, we provide interdisciplinary research at the interface of food science, biotechnology, and computer science. Until September 2020, I was a post-doctoral researcher and lead the Internet-of-things and Cyber-physical Systems group at the Chair of Software Engineering (lead by Prof. Samuel Kounev) of the University of Würzburg. Before, I was a doctoral researcher at the Information System II Chair (lead by Prof. Christian Becker) at the University of Mannheim, where I also received my PhD with summa cum laude in 2018. In my Ph.D. thesis, I developed the FESAS Framework to simplify and support the development of self-adaptive systems. Before, I received my M.Sc. in Business Informatics from the University of Mannheim in Germany in October 2012 and my B. Sc. Business Informatics from the University of Mannheim in Germany in June 2010.

My main research interests center Self-aware Computing Systems and Self-adaptive Systems, Machine Learning, and Augmented/Virtual Reality. Currently, I focus the domain of food processing systems and related areas such as the food supply chain, or smart health. Besides, I am applying or applied my methods in the domains of platooning and (self-driving) smart cars, intelligent transportation systems, Industry 4.0, and sports analytics and training support. I was awarded scholarships and grants from DAAD, Julius-Paul-Stiegler-Memorial-Foundation, and IEEE CS TCPP & TCCC. Further, my publication “Hips Do Lie! A Position-Aware Mobile Fall Detection System” was nominated as Best Paper Candidate for the PerCom 2018. Further, I am serving as reviewer and technical program committee member in several workshops, conferences and journals, such as CCNC, ITSC, PerCom, and ACSOS (merger of the IEE/ACM ICAC and the IEEE SASO). Additionally, I am involved at ACSOS as administrative support of the Steering Committee.
